There is only one general requirement: use tabs instead of spaces. 4 spaces = 1 tab. That's all.

It's appreciated if you write your code in style already similar to the addon, though.
But that's not neccessary. Plus my conventions are wacky, so I won't even specify them here.

The best way to contribute is, obviously, forking the repository, doing your changes, and opening a pull request.

If you want to, go for it! I'll probably accept your pull request. Below are a few things to note.

# Changing weapon stats

There are only two requirements.

1. Keep it absurdly canonical and realistic (if it's a real gun, use real life stats). Even if it means being unbalanced.
2. Keep the damage high. Since Source Engine doesn't have a realistic injury system, setting a gun to two shot someone for realism is okay. In fact, most guns here will.
In fact in fact, most guns here need slight damage changes that I am too lazy to do.

# Replacing direct key access for entities with MyTable

Look for any example of `MyTable` the code for what I mean. Doing that is always appreciated!
